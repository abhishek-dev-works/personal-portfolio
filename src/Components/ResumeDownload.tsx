        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>
          Loosely crafted in Figma and brought to life in Visual Studio Code,
          this website is a testament to my love for design and development.
          I've woven together React.js to create a seamless user experience,
          with every pixel meticulously placed for aesthetic perfection. All
          text is elegantly set in the Inter typeface, enhancing readability and
          visual harmony.
        </p>
        <h3>Let's build together</h3>
        <p>
          While this portfolio is a showcase of my skills, it's also an open
          invitation to collaborate on exciting projects. Whether you have a
          concept that needs a digital touch or want to brainstorm new ideas,
          I'm here to bring creativity and expertise to the table.
        </p>
